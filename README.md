# Orbital Resonance Plotter

Given three orbital parameters (apoapsis, periapsis, standard gravitational parameter) for two Kepler bodies, this script draws a line between the bodies' location at multiple (1–10000) snapshots in their relative orbits. It's kinda like spirograph, but with more maths.

Apsides are 1/1000000 real-world scale.
Gravitational parameters are 1/10000000000 real-world scale.
Scientific accuracy has been sacrificed in the interests of aesthetics.
